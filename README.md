# PadLock
A secure password generator made in Python

# How To Use
Install the latest Python 3 package from python.org or from the terminal, then run it in the terminal using python3 padlock.py

# INFO
I will make a Windows EXE version later down the road, but for now, it's only available on Linux (unless you want to change the "os.system('clear')" to 'cls'.
